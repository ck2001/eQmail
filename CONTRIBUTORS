eQmail includes some 'foreign' code, provided more or indirect by
some people through patches for (net)qmail and separate software
packages. I wish to thank all for their work, especially

- Dan J. Berstein for qmail itself
- the m√∂tley crue of netqmail (see netqmail's docs)
- Pawel Foremsky for his qmail-spp patch
- Frederick Vermeulen for his great TLS patch
- Erwin Hoffmann (feh) for the 'auth' patch and his contribution to
  qlibs socket code
- Felix von Leitner (fefe) for libowfat

I wish to thank all the others not explicitly mentiond here which
contributed code, patches and documentation.
