/var/spool/eqmail-queue

This is the eQmail queue directory.  It must be  a directory at a local
filesystem.  Usual '/var/spool'  is the common main  directory for such
purposes in most cases. This is where eQmail queues  all mail messages.
If the main directory differs from 'conf-home',  a link will be created
during standard installation inside the eQmail home directory.

The queue could be shared between  multiple installations of eQmail and
perhaps derivatives (e.g. netqmail)  as long the same  queue-processing
is used (e.g. 'big-todo'). Be warned about sharing.

The queue  (except for bounce message contents) is  crashproof,  if the
filesystem  guarantees  that  single-byte  writes are atomic  and  that
directory operations  are synchronous.  These guarantees  are  provided
by fixed-block filesystems like UFS and journaling filesystems.

IMPORTANT:  On recent versions of OpenBSD it will not work if the queue
is somewhere under '/var' by default. Reason is like '/var/' is mounted
(mount options).
