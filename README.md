# eQmail

eQmail was forked from netqmail-1.05 by applying some public (standard) patches. The
patched source code was saved to have it  available in the future,  instead of doing
it again and again. eQmail provides authentication, TLS and IPv6 out of the box.  It
includes  some other useful patches too.  Nevertheless  eQmail is positioned to be a
plain MTA, not a feature-rich mail suite.  As of its design it is simply to add
additional functionality through plugins and/or wrappers.
