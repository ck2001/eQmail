Installation

The install process didn't change. It is still like with netqmail-1.6. 
Refer to the related documentation.

Alternatively replace the executables of an existing (net)qmail instal-
lation only. First of all backup your /var/qmail/bin folder.
Compile the package with make and copy the executables into the (usually)
/var/qmail/bin folder. Overwrite all existing files. This can be done with
particular files only too (e.g. qmail-smtpd and/or qmail-remote). Set right
permissions (especially of qmail-queue).
Copy the modified man pages qmail-smtpd.8, qmail-remote.8 and qmail-control.9 
to their proper location too.


New configuration options

Read the patched manual pages mentioned above about the new options. For
usage of the qmail-spp plugins refer to http://qmail-spp.sourceforge.net/
as a starting point.
IMPORTANT: create the file control/smtpplugins manually. It have to 
           exists in any case!

The creation of this package was done careful as I was able to do it. Feel
free to analyze it for potential or real bugs. Fix them and send me the 
fix. If somebody is interessted to join this project please feel free to
